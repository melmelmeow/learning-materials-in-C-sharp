Csharp Exercise DSA

# Exercise 1: Arrays in Static Linear Data Structure
Task: Create an array of 5 student names. Print them, then replace the 3rd student with "ElderSlyLich" and print again. and do adding a search function to find if "Dana" exists or not.

# Exercise 2: Linked List in Dynamic Linear Data Structure
Task: Use a =LinkedList<int>= to store numbers. insert =5,10,15= . Then remove =10= and print the list. and do add a method to search for a number in the list.

# Exercise 3: Stack (LIFO)
Task: Implement a stack using =Stack<string>. Push 3 items, then pop one and print the stack. and do writting your own =ArrayStack<T>= class.

# Exercise 4: Queue (FIFO)
Task: Use a =Queue<int>= to enqueue numbers =1,2,3=. Dequeue one and print the queue. and do a write a method that prints the front element without removing it.

# Exercise 5: Binary Tree Traversal
Task: Build a small binary tree and print values usinf inorder traversal. and do a preorder and postorder traversals.

# Exercise 6: Searching Algorithm 
Task: Implement a Linear Search for an array. and do compare with Binary Search on a sorted array.

# Exercise 7: Sorting Algorithm 
Task: Implement the Bubble Sort. and do add Selecion Sort and compare performance.
